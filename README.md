__IDE: Apache Netbeans__

## Learning:
You will learn how to work with Java Swing. Simple design using NetBeans. Just drag and drop the design you want, and the code will auto-generate according to the design. After that, you will write the necessary command you want to execute.

NOTE: There will be only one admin/owner. That is already fixed. He can add staff if he wants. Here MySql has been used as the database. So, first it needs to connect to the database.
